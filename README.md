## Introduction

pyMelt is a python package for calculating the melting behaviour of mantle comprising multiple lithologies. The module implements the melting equations developed by Phipps Morgan (2001) to calculate the melting behaviour of mantle comprising any chosen lithology.

Currently supported calculations:

* Adiabatic decompression melting
* Isobaric melting

Parameters that can be calculated:

* The geotherm for decompressing mantle
* Melt fractions for each lithology
* Crustal thickness for passive-upwelling at a mid-ocean ridge
* Crystallisation temperatures (following the method in Matthews et al., 2016)
