# Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to pyMelt are welcomed. The package is designed to be easily expanded to add new melting regimes, the calculation of additional melting region properties, and the addition of other melting models.

We encourage contributors to reach out to Simon Matthews (simonwmatthews@gmail.com) at any stage of the process. When documenting issues, please provide an example of code that generated the issue.

If you would like contribute code to the library, you can submit a pull-request. Before doing this
make sure that the updated library passes flake8 and all the unittests (work in progress).
