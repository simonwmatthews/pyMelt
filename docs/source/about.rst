About pyMelt
############

PyMelt is an open-source python library for calculating the melting behaviour of the Earth's
mantle. The library implements the melting equations for multi-component mantle set out by
`Phipps Morgan (2001) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2000GC000049>`_ alongside a number of melting models
for lherzolite and pyroxenite lithologies.

How to Cite PyMelt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A manuscript is in preparation and a preprint is available here:

Simon Matthews, Kevin Wong, & Matthew Gleeson. (2022). PyMelt: An extensible Python engine for mantle melting calculations. EarthArXiv. https://doi.org/10.31223/X5JP7X

Until then, it is important to cite the release of pyMelt that you have used in your project. The Zenodo archive of the current stable release is:

   Simon Matthews & Kevin Wong. (2020). simonwmatthews/pyMelt: v2.00: pyMelt manuscript resubmission. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7101330

      :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7101330

You should also cite the individual pure-lithology melting models used in the calculation. See the
models page for more information.

GitHub
^^^^^^
The pyMelt source code is available on `github <https://github.com/simonwmatthews/pyMelt>`_. The
package is in continual development, see the branches labelled "dev" for the latest updates. If you
spot a bug, or you have a feature request, please raise this as an issue on github.
