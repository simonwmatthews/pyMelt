About pyMelt
############

pyMelt is an open-source python library for calculating the melting behaviour of the Earth's
mantle. The library implements the melting equations for multi-component mantle set out by
`Phipps Morgan (2001) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2000GC000049>`_ alongside a number of melting models
for lherzolite and pyroxenite lithologies.

How to Cite pyMelt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A manuscript is in preparation and a preprint will be posted soon. Until then, it is important to
cite the release of pyMelt that you have used in your project. The zenodo archive of the current
stable release is:

   Simon Matthews, Oliver Shorttle, & Kevin Wong. (2020). simonwmatthews/pyMelt: First Release (v1.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4011814

You should also cite the individual pure-lithology melting models used in the calculation. See the
models page for more information.

GitHub
^^^^^^
The pyMelt source code is available on `github <https://github.com/simonwmatthews/pyMelt>`_. The
package is in continual development, see the branches labelled "dev" for the latest updates. If you
spot a bug, or you have a feature request, please raise this as an issue on github.
