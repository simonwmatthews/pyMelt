About pyMelt
############

pyMelt is an open-source python library for calculating the melting behaviour of the Earth's
mantle. The library implements the melting equations for multi-component mantle set out by
`Phipps Morgan (2001) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2000GC000049>`_ alongside a number of melting models
for lherzolite and pyroxenite lithologies.

How to Cite pyMelt
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you have used pyMelt in your research please cite the 
`pyMelt paper <https://doi.org/10.30909/vol.05.02.469475>`_ published by Volcanica.
To ensure reproducibility, please also note the version of the library you have
used in your calculations.

You should also cite the individual pure-lithology melting models used in the calculation. See the
models page for more information.

GitHub
^^^^^^
The pyMelt source code is available on `github <https://github.com/simonwmatthews/pyMelt>`_. The
package is in continual development, see the branches labelled "dev" for the latest updates. If you
