About
^^^^^
pyMelt is an open-source python library for calculating the melting behaviour of the Earth's
mantle. The library implements the melting equations for multi-component mantle set out by
`Phipps Morgan (2001) <https://doi.org/10.1029/2000GC000049>`_ alongside a number of melting models
for lherzolite and pyroxenite lithologies.


You can try out pyMelt without installing it by using the myBinder service.
